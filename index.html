            <ul>
                <li><strong>DNS</strong>: The Domain Name System translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>IP Addresses</strong>: Every device on the internet has a unique IP address used for communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocols</strong>: HTTP/HTTPS are protocols used to transfer data between a client and a server.</li>
            </ul>
